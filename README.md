<h1>Python Projects<h1>

These are some basic projects I have created with Python.  Some of these projects use modules such as tkinter and sqlite3.

Projects:
<ul>
  <li>Check Files Gui</li>
  <li>Student Tracker</li>
  <li>Django University</li>
  <li>Django Checkbook</li>
</ul>

<h2>Check Files Gui</li>
In this project I created an gui app that allows the user to choose two folders to transfer files between if the files have been modified in the last 24 hours.  

<h2>Student Tracker</h2>
In this project I created a functional phonebook that uses a tkinter gui to add students names, phone numbers, email addresses, and course info to a sqlite3 database.

<h2>Django University</h2> 
This project uses Django to create a back end database where the user can add infomration to a Classes database

<h2>Django Checkbook</h2>
This project uses Django to create a fully functional front end website where the user can create an account to track their spending and balance.
